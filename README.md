Progress for the days already available:

## How to run
If you want to run the program for a specific day "XX" and a problem "Y" (1 or 2), use:
```bash
v run ./dayXX/pbY/
```

## Content
This repository contain one directory per day and each day contains two directories: one for each problem of the day (./dayXX/pbY/ for problem Y of day XX). For each problem, there are three files:
1. solution.v: the program to solve the problem
2. test.txt: test data that is usually provided in the problem statement
3. input.txt: input data
