## How to run
If you want to run the program for a specific day "XX" and a problem "Y" (1 or 2), use:
```bash
v run ./dayXX/pbY/
```
> Note: you will need to add the input file as `input.txt` in the `./dayXX/pbY/` directory since I cannot provide the inputs on github as stated in the [AOC rules](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about).

## Content
This repository contains one directory per day and each day contains two directories: one for each problem of the day (`./dayXX/pbY/` for problem Y of day XX).
